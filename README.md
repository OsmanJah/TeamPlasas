## Setup Instructions

### Clone or Download the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OsmanJah/TeamPlasas.git
```

### Install Prerequisites
Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed on your system, then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Run the Game
Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

On some systems, you may need to use:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Assets Required
Confirm that images (player, toy items, power-ups) and audio files (music, sound effects) are in the correct `assets/` folders. If you encounter missing-file errors, check `constants.py` and `power_up.py` for the exact paths.

## How to Play
